## 🧠 Sample Chat

**You:** “I’ve been feeling low and anxious lately.”  
**MindEase:**  
> That sounds really heavy. You’ve been trying so hard — and it’s okay to slow down.  
> What’s been stressing you most recently?  
> Maybe try these:  
> 1. Step outside for a 5-minute walk  
> 2. Write what’s on your mind  
> 3. Listen to something calm  
> You’re doing better than you think 💛
